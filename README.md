# donors-choose
__Description__
- DonorsChoose.org receives hundreds of thousands of project proposals each year for classroom projects in need of funding. Right now, a large number of volunteers is needed to manually screen each submission before it's approved to be posted on the DonorsChoose.org website.
- DonorsChoose.org expects to receive close to 500,000 project proposals. 

__Problems they need to solve__

- How to scale current manual processes and resources to screen 500,000 projects so that they can be posted as quickly and as efficiently as possible
- How to increase the consistency of project vetting across different volunteers to improve the experience for teachers.
- How to focus volunteer time on the applications that need the most assistance.

__Problem Statement__
- The goal of the project is to predict whether or not a DonorsChoose.org project proposal submitted by a teacher will be approved or not, using the text of project descriptions as well as additional metadata about the project, teacher, and school. 
- DonorsChoose.org can then use this information to identify projects most likely to need further review before approval.
